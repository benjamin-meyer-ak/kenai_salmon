Returns are plotted separately for populations or \u201cruns\u201d of each species that differ in spawning habitat and timing. The early runs of each species spawn in tributaries not influenced by lakes or glaciers (N). The late runs spawn predominantly in tributaries influenced by lakes (L) or in the mainstem influenced by glaciers and lakes (G + L). Returns have varied by roughly an order of magnitude (7- to 13-fold) over the period of record for all five runs (note the log-scaled y-axis).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please see the following journal article: Schoen et al. 2017.
