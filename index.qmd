In Alaska's Northern Kenai Peninsula region, wild salmon fisheries exemplify the high social, economic, and ecological value of wild salmon and the complex changes they face in the Gulf of Alaska region. Wild salmon harvest is central to the region's economic base and food sovereignty, allowing tens of thousands of Alaskans to harvest a sustainable, wild, and local protein. Whether it is to fill the family freezer in the personal use and sport fisheries, take home a paycheck from commercial fishing, or sustain cultural traditions in customary and traditional harvest, people of southcentral Alaska count on the millions of salmon that return each year to the Kenai and Kasilof rivers.

As the population has grown and economy of southcentral Alaska has evolved in the 21st century, the magnitude of harvest of wild salmon by the region's distinct user groups has shifted dramatically. Since 1970's, combined harvest by sport and personal use fisheries have grown from under 10% prior to 1995 to 44% in year 2022. The shift signals a strong growth in demand for the opportunity to independently harvest the region's salmon both for local, family-scale consumption as well as for tourism purposes.

The shift in the magnitude of fishery user group participation has affected local livelihoods and management concerns, benefitting some groups while challenging others. For all groups, managers are challenged to meet escapement goals for low-abundance but high-profile Chinook salmon, which are intermingled among the much more abundant sockeye salmon. Concerns over Chinook bycatch in this mixed-stock fishery are the primary reason stated by regulators that has led to closure of the "East Side" commercial set net fishery and the Kenai River Chinook sport fishery.

As harvest trends change and competition intensifies among user groups, commercial, sport, personal use, and traditional & customary fishery participants will benefit to better understand each others needs and challenges.

The area sustains several of Alaskaâ€™s largest recreational salmon fisheries, major commercial gill-net and personal-use dip-net fisheries, as well as small-scale subsistence and educational fisheries (Begich et al. 2013; Shields and Dupuis 2016).

The region is also home to Alaska's most populous communities, Additionally it is visited by hundreds of thousands of annual visitors also seeking to harvest salmon in growing sport fisheries.

The region's most productive river, the Kenai River, is famous for its large Chinook Salmon *O. tshawytscha*, including a 44-kg (97 lb) world record fish caught in 1985.

However, recent declines in Chinook Salmon returns have prompted fishery closures and exacerbated long-standing conflicts between stake- holders (Loring 2016). These declines, coinciding with state-wide declines in Chinook Salmon returns and body size (ADFG 2013; Lewis et al. 2015), have raised concerns about the resilience of these salmon runs and their dependent fishing communities to rapid environmental change (Loring et al. 2014).
