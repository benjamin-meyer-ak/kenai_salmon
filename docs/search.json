To make comparisons within a common geographic area, we aggregated harvest and effort data from the northern Kenai Peninsula, ranging from the Kasilof River in the south to Ingram Creek in the north. The Kenai River is the predominant salmon-producing river in this area.\nWe aggregated harvest and effort data from the following fisheries:\nWarning: Removed 13 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`)."
