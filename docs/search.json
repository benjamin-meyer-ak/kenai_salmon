    "text": "1.1 Geographical Areas\nWe assembled total salmon harvest data from the northern Kenai Peninsula area from 1966 - 2023, organized by fishery sector (commercial, sport, and personal use) and species. Our primary data source was Annual Management Reports from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, as well as data assembled in (Schoen et al. 2017).\nHarvest and effort data are reported differently for the commercial, recreational, and personal-use fisheries in Upper Cook Inlet, such that for this analysis it is not possible to compare the harvest and effort of salmon produced specifically by the Kenai or Kasilof Rivers (including their tributaries) by each fishing sector. To make comparisons within a common geographic area, we aggregated harvest and effort data from the northern Kenai Peninsula, ranging from the Kasilof River in the south to Ingram Creek in the north. The Kenai River is the predominant salmon-producing river in this area (adapted from (Schoen et al. 2017)).\nFigure 1.1: Upper Cook Inlet Central Disrtrict, commercial drift gillnet statsitical areas.
